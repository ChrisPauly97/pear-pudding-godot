# Art Sprite Assets

## Key Features

- Replaces every procedural `TextureGen` placeholder with real, license-clean pixel art:
  - Enemies: `TextureGen.enemy(is_roaming_boss, is_boss)` — `scenes/world/entities/EnemyNPC.gd:15`, `ScoutAmbush.gd:12`
  - NPCs: `npc_townsperson()` (`TownspersonNPC.gd:14`), `npc_merchant(is_traveling)` (`MerchantNPC.gd:12`), `npc_maiteln()` (`MaitelnFollower.gd:65`)
  - Props: `prop(key)` — `scenes/world/ChunkRenderer.gd:343`, keys from `BiomeDef.PROP_SETS`
  - Mount: `mount_horse()` — `Player.gd:122`
  - Card illustrations: `card_illustration(card_id, magic_branch)` — `autoloads/CardRegistry.gd:178`
- Player wizard already has real art (`assets/textures/pixel_art/wizard_walk_{1-4}_pixel.png` via `AvatarSprite.gd`); an optional swap is shortlisted for style coherence.
- CC0-first policy; CC-BY fallback with verbatim attribution; `TextureGen` stays as graceful fallback for missing files (TID-446/447).

## Research Constraints (how this list was built)

Researched 2026-07-16 in a sandboxed session. As with the soundtrack research (see
`docs/agent/audio-soundtrack.md`), **the outbound proxy 403-blocks direct fetches of
asset sites** — licenses were verified via web-search snippets that explicitly state
the license. Every pick below says *license verified* (snippet stated it) or
*unconfirmed* (must check on-page). **The human performing TID-445 must confirm the
license shown on each page at download time.** Sprite-sheet contents (exact frame
names/counts) also could not be inspected remotely — rosters below are from pack
familiarity and search snippets; final slot assignment is confirmed when the sheets
are on disk.

## Style Strategy

Two coherent CC0 families are shortlisted. **Pick ONE as the base for all humanoids**
— do not mix them within a slot group:

- **Family A (primary): 0x72 — 16x16 DungeonTileset II** — https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii — **CC0** (license verified). Animated heroes (~16×28: 4 idle + 4 run frames each) and a large monster roster (small/large zombies, skeletons, orcs, shamans, necromancers, imps, demons, goblins, ogre/big_demon boss-scale sprites, animated chest ≈ mimic). Moodier dungeon-crawl look.
- **Family B (backup/alt): Kenney *Tiny Dungeon* + *Tiny Town* + clintbellanger *Tiny Creatures*** — https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon , https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-town , https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-creatures — all **CC0** (license verified). 16×16 thick-outline style, 130+130+180 assets; Tiny Creatures adds 100+ classic monsters and 50+ animals. Friendlier storybook look — arguably closer to the Hobbit/Redwall tone, but sprites are 16×16 (squatter than the current 16×32 wizard).

The existing player wizard frames are 16×32 hand-made and match neither family
exactly. Recommendation: adopt Family A and swap the player to 0x72's `wizzard_m`
hero (idle+run frames drop straight into `AvatarSprite.build()`'s two animations) —
flagged as a **user decision** in TID-445.

## Sprite Manifest (target paths)

| Slot | Path | Size target | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enemy: undead | `assets/textures/characters/enemy_undead.png` | 16×28–32 | EnemyNPC via SpriteRegistry (TID-446) |
| Enemy: undead elite | `assets/textures/characters/enemy_undead_elite.png` | 16×28–32 | undead_elite.tres |

## Shortlist Per Slot Group

### Enemy archetypes + NPCs + optional player swap
- **Primary:** 0x72 — 16x16 DungeonTileset II — **CC0** (license verified) — https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii
  - Suggested mapping (confirm frame names in the downloaded sheet; `tiles_list_v1.4` in the pack names every sprite): undead → `skelet`, undead elite → recolor or `masked_orc`-class undead variant, ghoul → `zombie`/`ice_zombie`, raider → `masked_orc`/`orc_warrior`, warleader → `ogre` or `orc_shaman`, duelist → `necromancer`, rival → hero `elf_m` or recolored `wizzard_f`, terror → `big_demon`, mimic → animated `chest` frames; townsperson → hero `knight_f`/`elf_f` recolors, merchant → `doc` or robed variant, Maiteln → `wizzard_m` (if player doesn't take it) or recolor.
  - Attribution: none required (CC0); courtesy credit "0x72 — dungeontileset-ii" in CREDITS.
  - Work needed: crop frames from the single sheet (`0x0072_DungeonTilesetII_v1.4.png`) using the pack's coordinates list; simple palette recolors for variants are license-fine.
- **Backup:** Kenney Tiny Dungeon + clintbellanger Tiny Creatures — **CC0** (license verified) — https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon , https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-creatures
  - 16×16 sprites; same mapping approach; Tiny Creatures covers ghost/zombie/skeleton classics directly.

### Props (10 keys)
- **Primary:** Kenney Tiny Town + Tiny Dungeon objects/foliage — **CC0** (license verified) — https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-town
  - Covers rock/boulder/flower/mushroom/tree-ish foliage; cactus/thorn/ash/ember/fern/lichen may need recolors of nearby pieces (CC0 permits freely). Keep 16×16.
- **Backup:** Danaida — Free Pixel Plants 16x16 (70 tiles) — commercial use allowed per page; **exact license text unconfirmed — check page** — https://danaida.itch.io/free-pixel-plants-16x16
  - Strong plant coverage (fern/flower/mushroom); combine with primary for mineral/ember keys.

### Mount
- **Primary:** clintbellanger — Tiny Creatures (50+ animals) — **CC0** (license verified) — https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-creatures
  - Confirm a horse sprite is present when the sheet is on disk (50+ animals; 16×16 — will render smaller than the current 48×24 silhouette; acceptable, or nearest-upscale ×2).
- **Backup:** search OpenGameArt for "horse sprite CC0" at download time (several exist; none could be license-confirmed via snippets this session). **Avoid LPC horses** (CC-BY-SA 3.0/GPL — share-alike burden, last resort only).

### Card illustrations (ghost, skeleton, zombie, ghoul) + spell runes
- **Primary (creatures):** reuse monster sprites from the chosen humanoid family (0x72 zombie/skeleton; Tiny Creatures ghost), cropped to a single frame and nearest-upscaled to 32×32 — zero additional license burden, guaranteed style match with the world.
- **Primary (spell runes):** game-icons.net rune/spell icons — **CC-BY 3.0** (license verified) — https://game-icons.net
  - Attribution text (site's stated form): `Icons made by {author}. Available on https://game-icons.net` — record each icon's author from its page.
  - Work needed: icons are SVG/monochrome — export at 32×32 PNG, optionally tint per magic branch.
- **Backup:** game-icons.net for the creature slots too (it has ghost/skeleton/zombie icons; same CC-BY 3.0 attribution).

## Acquisition Instructions (for TID-445)

Sandbox sessions cannot download from these sites (proxy 403) — a human must do this
on their own machine.

1. **Decide the style family** (A: 0x72, B: Kenney Tiny) — and whether the player
   wizard swaps to the pack's wizard (recommendation: yes with Family A).
2. Download the chosen packs; confirm the license shown on each page matches this doc.
3. Crop sheets into per-slot PNGs at the manifest paths above. 0x72 ships a sprite
   coordinates list in the zip; ImageMagick example:
   `magick sheet.png -crop 16x28+368+16 +repage enemy_undead.png`
4. Keep transparent backgrounds; never resample/smooth-scale (nearest-integer upscale
   only, e.g. `magick in.png -filter point -resize 200% out.png`).
5. For CC-BY items (game-icons.net) copy the icon author names and the exact
   attribution wording from the page — TID-446/447 need them verbatim for CREDITS.
6. If a pack includes walk/idle animation frames for enemies/NPCs, ALSO save them as
   `<slot>_walk_{1-N}.png` alongside the static frame — TID-446 treats animation as
   optional bonus scope.
7. Commit the PNGs. `.import` sidecars are generated by editor/headless import;
   PNGs need no `.uid` sidecars.

## Acquisition Results (TID-445, 2026-07-16)

The proxy block that forced TID-445 to be a human-action task was gone when the task
ran — all packs downloaded and were placed **by the agent session** directly. Licenses
were re-verified at download time (0x72 page links CC0-1.0; Kenney/Tiny Creatures ship
`License.txt` with CC0; Danaida's author states "It's CC0." in the page comments —
no formal license metadata on that page, statement captured 2026-07-16).

**Family A (0x72) was adopted** for all humanoids, per this doc's recommendation.
The optional player-wizard swap was **deferred** (existing
`wizard_walk_{1-4}_pixel.png` untouched; `wizzard_m` went to Maiteln instead — if the
player swap is ever wanted, pick a different hero for Maiteln, e.g. a `wizzard_f`
recolor). All static slots also got optional 4-frame walk animations
(`<slot>_walk_{1-4}.png`, from the packs' run/anim frames) except mimic (3 frames)
and single-frame slots (townsperson variants, merchant).

Actual slot → source mapping (all placed at the manifest paths):

| Slot | Source |
|---|---|
| enemy_undead | 0x72 `skelet_idle_anim_f0` (walk = `skelet_run` f0–f3), 16×16 |
| enemy_undead_elite | spectral blue recolor (RGB ×0.6/0.8/1.25) of `skelet` frames |
| enemy_ghoul | 0x72 `swampy_anim` f0–f3 (the pack's `zombie` is a plant-stump sprite — reads wrong for a ghoul) |
| enemy_raider | 0x72 `masked_orc` idle/run, 16×23 |
| enemy_warleader | 0x72 `ogre` idle/run, 32×36 (boss scale) |
| enemy_duelist | 0x72 `necromancer_anim` f0–f3, 16×23 |
| enemy_rival | 0x72 `elf_m` idle/run, 16×28 |
| enemy_terror | 0x72 `big_demon` idle/run, 32×36 |
| enemy_mimic | 0x72 `chest_mimic_open_anim` f0 (walk 1–3 = f0–f2), 16×16 |
| npc_townsperson / _2 / _3 | 0x72 `elf_f` / `dwarf_m` / `knight_f` idle f0, 16×28 |
| npc_merchant / _traveling | 0x72 `doc` idle f0 / run f0, 16×23 |
| npc_maiteln | 0x72 `wizzard_m` idle f0 (walk = run f0–f3), 16×28 |
| mount_horse | Tiny Creatures `tile_0051` (brown horse), black bg keyed out, nearest ×2 → 32×32 |
| prop_rock | Tiny Creatures `tile_0058`, black bg keyed out |
| prop_boulder | granite-blue recolor (×0.72/0.76/0.9) of `tile_0058` |
| prop_ash_pile | Tiny Creatures `tile_0089`, keyed |
| prop_ember | Tiny Creatures `tile_0056` (small flame), keyed |
| prop_mushroom | Kenney Tiny Town `tile_0029` |
| prop_flower / fern / cactus / thorn / lichen | Danaida plants `24` / `53` / `40` / `8` / `65` |
| card_ghost | Kenney Tiny Dungeon `tile_0121` (classic white ghost), ×2 → 32×32 |
| card_skeleton | 0x72 `skelet_idle_anim_f0` ×2 → 32×32 |
| card_zombie | 0x72 `big_zombie_idle_anim_f0` content-cropped to 32×32 |
| card_ghoul | 0x72 `swampy_anim_f0` ×2 → 32×32 (matches world ghoul) |
| rune_dawn / dusk / ember / ash | game-icons.net "Sunrise" (Delapouite) / "Sunset" (Delapouite) / "Burning embers" (Lorc) / "Dust cloud" (Lorc), SVG rendered at 32×32 and tinted to the TextureGen branch colors |

Note for TID-446/447: Tiny Creatures sprites keep the pack's dark-maroon contour
outline (consistent with 0x72's outlines); only the pure-black square background was
keyed to transparent. The rune PNGs are anti-aliased (vector-rendered, not pixel art) —
alpha carries the edge smoothing.

## Asset Requirements

| Asset | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Character/NPC/enemy sprites | `assets/textures/characters/*.png` | Wired by TID-446 (SpriteRegistry + fallback to TextureGen) |
| Prop sprites ×10 | `assets/textures/props/prop_<key>.png` | Wired by TID-447 (SpriteRegistry.prop_texture, ChunkRenderer instancing unchanged) |
| Mount sprite | `assets/textures/characters/mount_horse.png` | Wired by TID-447 (SpriteRegistry.mount_texture, Player.gd) |
| Card art + runes | `assets/textures/cards/*.png` | Wired by TID-447 (SpriteRegistry.card_illustration_texture, CardRegistry) |
| CREDITS entries | repo root `CREDITS.md` | Author, license, URL per sprite; verbatim CC-BY text for game-icons.net; per-slot index table |

Integration notes for TID-446/447:
- Literal `const` preloads only (Android rule) — one per PNG; dictionaries with literal
  string keys and preloaded values are fine.
- Keep `TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST`, billboard, alpha-cut settings; feet-at-y=0 formula
  reads texture height — do not hard-code 32.
- Run headless parse/import check after every `.gd` edit; full test runner at the end.

## Integration Status (TID-446, 2026-07-16)

**Characters/enemies/NPCs are INTEGRATED** via `game_logic/SpriteRegistry.gd`
(RefCounted, statics, one literal preload per PNG):

- `enemy_texture(etype, is_roaming_boss, is_boss)` — covers every `EnemyRegistry` id
  including `undead_horde` and the night-hunt `spectre_wisp/haunt/dread` tiers (a gap
  in the original manifest — fixed by adding `enemy_spectre.png`, Kenney Tiny Dungeon
  white ghost `tile_0121`, CC0; the spectral node modulate in WorldScene differentiates
  tiers). Roaming boss → terror; unknown boss → warleader; unknown regular type →
  `null` → caller falls back to `TextureGen.enemy()`.
- `townsperson_texture(seed)` (3 variants, stable hash), `merchant_texture(is_traveling)`,
  `maiteln_texture()`, `raider_texture()` (ScoutAmbush, 0.04 px size + green tint).
- `setup_sprite(sprite, tex, pixel_size=CHAR_PIXEL_SIZE)` sets texture/pixel size and
  the feet-at-y=0 position from the real texture height. `CHAR_PIXEL_SIZE = 0.05`
  (pack humanoids are 16–36 px vs the old fixed 32 px at 0.04).
- Call sites converted: `EnemyNPC.gd`, `ScoutAmbush.gd`, `TownspersonNPC.gd`,
  `MerchantNPC.gd`, `MaitelnFollower.gd`. Billboard/alpha-cut/nearest settings kept.
- Attribution: root `CREDITS.md` created (TID-437 will merge music credits into it).
- Walk frames on disk were NOT wired at the time (static Sprite3D call sites) —
  see the BID-051 resolution below; Maiteln now animates.

## Integration Status (TID-447, 2026-07-16)

**Props, mount, and card illustrations are now INTEGRATED**, extending the same
`SpriteRegistry` (not a second registry, per the task's own instruction):

- `prop_texture(key)` — 10 literal preloads keyed by the exact `BiomeDef.PROP_SETS`
  strings (`ash_pile`, matching the TID-445 correction, not the original `ash` draft).
  `ChunkRenderer._build_props()` tries the registry first, then `TextureGen.prop()`;
  the MultiMesh instancing path (shared material's `albedo_texture`) is untouched
  either way, so instancing performance is unaffected.
- `mount_texture()` — `mount_horse.png`. `Player.gd`'s mount sprite now computes its
  feet-at-y=0 offset from the real texture height instead of a hardcoded `0.6`
  (the old constant assumed `TextureGen`'s 24 px silhouette; the real sprite is a
  different size). `test_mount_dismount_visuals.gd` needed **no changes** — its two
  `TextureGen.mount_horse()` assertions test that fallback function directly, not
  Player's rendered sprite, and the visibility assertions don't touch texture identity.
- `card_illustration_texture(illus_key, magic_branch)` — `illus_key` is
  `"ghost"/"skeleton"/"zombie"/"ghoul"` for minions or `"spell"` (routed by
  `magic_branch`: `dawn`/`dusk`/`ember`/`ash`, the only 4 branches in `data/cards/`)
  for spells. `CardRegistry._ensure_loaded()` tries the registry first, then falls
  back to `TextureGen.card_illustration()`.
- All slots now traceable in `CREDITS.md`'s new per-slot index table.
- **Nothing left procedural except the fallback path itself** — all sprite
  slots (enemies, NPCs, props, mount, card illustrations) render real,
  license-clean pixel art. `TextureGen`'s procedural generators remain wired
  as the runtime fallback for every slot, never deleted.

## BID-051 Resolution: Maiteln Walk Animation (2026-07-16)

Investigated wiring the walk-frame PNGs shipped by TID-445 for every entity.
Reading `EnemyNPC.gd`, `ScoutAmbush.gd`, `TownspersonNPC.gd`, and
`MerchantNPC.gd` confirmed none of them have any `_process()` movement — they
are placed once and never move, so animating a walk cycle on them would show
a pointless idle-twitch. **Only `MaitelnFollower` visibly moves** (follows the
player / lerps toward a networked position), so only he was wired:
`SpriteRegistry.maiteln_walk_frames()` (4 literal preloads) feeds a
`SpriteFrames`-based `AnimatedSprite3D` built by
`MaitelnFollower._build_animated_sprite()` (mirrors `AvatarSprite.build()`'s
idle/walk pattern), swapping in for the old static `Sprite3D` with the same
registry-then-`TextureGen` fallback chain. `_process()` computes an
"is moving this frame" flag from the squared distance to the current
follow/network target (with a small epsilon so settling into place reads as
idle, not walk) and mirrors `Player.gd`'s screen-space `flip_h` heuristic.
The other entities' walk PNGs remain unwired on disk — not a gap, just
unused until/unless those entities ever gain wander movement.

## What "all textures use sprites" Does and Doesn't Cover

GID-118's scope was every `TextureGen` slot that draws a **placeholder
silhouette**: enemies, NPCs, props, the mount, and card illustrations. All of
those are now real sprites. Two things are deliberately **outside** that
scope and remain procedural, because they aren't silhouette placeholders:

- **Terrain tiles** (`grass_pixel.png`, `hill_side/top_pixel.png`,
  `wall_side/top_pixel.png`) — already real hand-made art from before this
  goal, unrelated to `TextureGen`.
- **`TextureGen.path()`** — a Simplex-noise-generated dirt-path texture fed to
  a terrain shader parameter (`WorldScene.gd:4557`, `path_texture`). This is a
  procedural ground-texture pattern, not a sprite; GID-118 never scoped it and
  no licensed replacement was researched.
